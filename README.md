# AgentSpeakProperties
Tool for assessing software properties of AgentSpeak code. This tool parses AgentSpeak code and generated metrics for assessing coupling, cohesion, and cyclomatic complexity. The tool outputs the relevant parameters and node graphs for the agent code.

Test cases are provided in the testCases.py script.

Future Work: Move parsing to use LEX and YACC, and generalize the analysis for AgentSpeak in general.
